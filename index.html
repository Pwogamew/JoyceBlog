            <h2>Introducing myself ☺</h2>
            <p>My name is Ms. Joyce Danielle S. Lomangaya and I am a teacher. I have been teaching for X years and I love it. I am currently teaching X grade at X school.</p>

            <h2>Happiness</h2>
            <p>First of... What is Happiness? Let me share to you a quote from a philosophy teacher. “Happiness is like a tree going into the sky, and sadness is like the roots going down into the womb of the earth. Both are needed, and the higher a tree goes, the deeper it goes, simultaneously. Sadness gives depth. Happiness gives height. Sadness gives roots. Happiness gives branches. The bigger the tree, the bigger will be its roots. In fact, it is always in proportion. That's its balance.” -Osho, a Philosophy Teacher<br><br>

            With that being said, there's no reason for us to dwell too much on a sad state to the point that it would affect the other people around us. Let's embrace the sadness we experience which comes with the pain and let the happiness that's on its way to wash it away like a rain. :)

            <h2>Profession</h2>
            <p>I did not ended up as a teacher just because someone said so. Teaching is my passion that I realized since when I was young. I love to teach my students in a way that would grab their attention. The secret of doing that is to be passionate in doing it. “Love what you teach, and they will love it too.” <br><br>

            Research links passionate teaching directly to a student's willingness to learn and experience new ideas. <br>
